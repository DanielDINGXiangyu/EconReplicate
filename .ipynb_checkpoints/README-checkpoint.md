I am DING Xiangyu, a second year master student of economics in Peking University. This repository includes my replication program of top journal papers in macroeconomics, presentation for PhD reading group, and past research projects.    

Replication:  
* **Replication program for Bansal & Yaron (2004, JF)**: *Risks for the Long Run: A Potential Resolution of Asset Pricing Puzzles* (Using Value Function Iteration)
* **Replication program for Croce (2014, JME)**: *Long-Run Productivity Risk: A New Hope for Production-Based Asset Pricing?*
* **Replication program for Leduc & Liu. (2016, JME)**: *Uncertainty Shocks Are Aggregate Demand Shocks*
* **Replication program for Liu et al. (2021, AEJ Macro)**: *Interest Rate Liberalization and Capital Misallocations*
  
Replication Research Projects: 
* **Analyst and TFP in China:**: My PKU master dissertation is a replciation research based on To et al. (2018, JCF) but using Chinese data. This project finds that analyst coverage significantly increases the productivity of the firms, but the positive effect decreases with the degree of analyst optimism.
* **BAB in China**: A replication research based on Frazzini & Pedersen (2014, JFE) using Chinese equity market data.
* **Numerical Project**: calculate implied volatility surface using data from future market.

Reading Group Presentations:
* **Presentation of Buera and Kaboski (2012, AER)**: *The Rise of the Service Economy.* With literature review of structural transformation theory.
* **Presentation for Chen et al. (2020, Working Paper)**: *Privatization and Productivity in China*.
* **Presentation of Diamond and Dybvig (1983,JPE)**: *Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity*.
